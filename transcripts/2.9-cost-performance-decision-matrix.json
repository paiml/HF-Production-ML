{"text":" Let's take a look at a cost performance decision matrix. In this case, we have GPU versus CPU versus WebAssembly. When do we use it in terms of a scatter plot here? We see on the X axis cost per hour on the Y axis, the throughputs and tokens per second. WebAssembly is going to be at the bottom left here. So near zero cost, but also low throughput. This would be really good for tiny models. For example, recording your voice transcriptions. CPU with CMD would be in the middle. This is Pane's per hour, so you get pretty good throughput because you can put multiple instructions in assembly. This is a sweet spot for medium models. And then you have things like a 10 GPU upper middle, so a dollar or two an hour, really high throughput, or an A100, $4 an hour maximum throughput. The idea here is that you have to pick the efficiency frontier to be the best throughput for the each type of model cost level comparison? So in terms of a decision tree, what we can do is think about the size. 100 megabytes web assembly could be a good fit. 100 megabytes to four gigs, CPU with SIMD. This could be a server or desktop over four gigs. This would be GPU. And then in terms of what about 10 milliseconds, maybe you would need a GPU. assembly or CPU is a good choice. So these are things to think about in terms of some of the examples we've shown as well like Whisper Tiny or an API shell. These run in the browser. They have offline capability and this allows you to choose the different comparisons for what the problem is you're trying to solve. So it's important to think about this when you're building out real world production systems. What are the problems solve and then how does that fit with the ecosystem and the capabilities that you have.","segments":[]}
