{"text":" And important component of large language model operations and dealing with the hugging phase and training ecosystem is corpus management. In this case, we want to have versioned training data that sits alongside model artifacts. If we look at the four stages, we have corpus, this would be the hugging phase data set. We have trained validation, test splits, and it's versioned like code. And we also have the ability in it. corpus and then an oracle learns the patterns. In the case of Deplier, the training would kick it off and then it learns to better transpile Python to Rust. In terms of evaluation, this is where we measure the accuracy. In the Deplier case, we have 78 to 80% single shot compile as one example and then you would look at the tarantula scoring for the defect localization. When you're done, you'd push the model and also the dataset to you link them together and you would have this feedback loop in terms of lineage as well. It's critical for reproducibility. So where was the model trained on what corpus and then you have that permanent link? Was there something wrong with the model? Okay, let's go ahead and check the corpus version and trace the problem. Transyliscoring is the idea of finding defect localization and the idea here is that if you have suspicious code, this code likely contained. for example, an async handler. Medium suspicion would be orange. It's worth investigating. Let's say a parser.pyline 128 or low suspicion. It's probably correct. Let's say utils.pyline 15. So the idea here is that the failed tests would then point to the suspicious code and then you have the idea of prioritizing your debugging efforts based on that. So in a nutshell, data operations is also really model operations, and the corpus versioning would live on the hugging face platform where your own local similar model and data repository, and then you would train evaluate and publish the cycle. So the core concept here is where should you deploy? This is important cost performance trade-off.","segments":[]}
